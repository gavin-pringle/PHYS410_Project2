\subsection*{Introduction}

In this project, the time-dependent Schrödinger equation is solved numerically in both one dimension
and two dimensions. In both cases, solutions account for a time-independent potential term $V$, which
takes the form of a rectangular barrier or well, a double slit (in 2d only), or is zero everywhere. 
The MATLAB script \code{sch\_1d\_cn.m} implements the Crank-Nicolson discretization approach to solve 
the Schrödinger equation in 1d, while the script \code{sch\_2d\_adi.m} implements the 
alternating-direction-implicit (ADI) method to solve the equation in 2d. 

The 1d case is tested by conducting convergence testing in the file \code{ctest\_1d.m} which checks 
for solution convergence among increasing discretization levels. A similar convergence test is done 
for two dimensions in the file \code{ctest\_2d.m}. For the 1d case, the solution "excess fractional
probability" is also examined in the files \code{barrier\_survey.m} and \code{well\_survey.m}, which
provides insights into how much time the quantum particle is spending in a certain location. Lastly,
videos of the 2d wave function scattering off a rectangular barrier or well, and producing 
self-interference through a double slit are created using the scripts \code{video\_rec\_bar.m},
\code{video\_rec\_well.m}, and \code{video\_double\_slit.m}.

\subsection*{Conclusions}

% Summarize work 
% Discuss how mostly successful except for perhaps well survey.

% Talk about performance issues. Could fix by preallocatting memory and using parallel computation.

Generative AI was used to help with understanding how to use MATLAB's \code{contourf} function for 
making videos of numerical experiments in 2d. It was also used for help with typesetting this document.
